# Starting the Test
This application includes just one page, which is served at the root directory when you visit http://localhost:8081. 
For some context, this was extracted from an existing design. The original mocks for this page can be found at `static/mocks`


The task here is pretty simple. Should not take too much of your time. Apologies, in advance, if it does.
Integrate this application into a new Rails 5.1 app, taking advantage of webpacker support in Rails 5.1 to bundle assets in the same manner it's currently being bundled.

Try to reduce redundancy as much as possible.
